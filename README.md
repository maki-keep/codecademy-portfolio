## Themes

There is a list of themes that requires "script/theme-toggle.js" and "themes/themes.css" to work. When no themes are available, when the "Clear themes" button is pressed (i.e. the local storage doesn't have the "theme" item), or at the first page visit, the page responds to the dark mode settings of the device currently in use; notice here the lack of the "Maven Pro" custom font.

## Privacy
