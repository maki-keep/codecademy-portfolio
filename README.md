## Media

## Themes

There is a list of themes that requires "scripts/theme-toggle.js" and "themes/themes.css" to work. When no custom theme is selected (i.e. the local storage doesn't have the "theme" item), the page responds to the dark mode settings of the device currently in use; notice here a different font.
